# Hufffman-Coding-Compression#

## 📖 Overview
The **Huffman Coding Compression Tool** is a GUI-based Python project that demonstrates how data compression works using the **Huffman Encoding Algorithm** — a classic Greedy Algorithm technique. It compresses and decompresses text by assigning shorter binary codes to frequently used characters, thus reducing overall size.
